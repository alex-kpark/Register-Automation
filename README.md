# AutomateRegister
Automated Python script for shopping mall sellers to register their products in multiple shoppingmalls

## Problem
1. Sellers have to upload one product in multiple shopping malls, and it takes a bunch of time to do the same work at different malls
2. If shoppingmall opens its API to seller, using API to register products would be a solution
3. If not, seller might use automation tools (maybe this script) to register products only with its information

## Files
